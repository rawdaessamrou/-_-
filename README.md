## TASK 1
### Credit Scoring Model
 Develop a credit scoring model to predict the
 creditworthiness of individuals based on historical
 financial data. Utilize classification algorithms and
 assess the model's accuracy.
 #### Overview

This project contains a machine learning model for credit scoring. The model predicts the likelihood of default on a credit application based on various features provided by the applicant.

#### Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset containing historical credit application data. The dataset consists of both numerical and categorical features such as age, income, employment status, and credit history.

#### Model Development

The machine learning model was developed using Python programming language and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. The model was trained using a supervised learning algorithm, specifically a random forest classifier, due to its ability to handle complex datasets and nonlinear relationships between features.

#### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the model was evaluated using standard evaluation metrics for classification tasks including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
