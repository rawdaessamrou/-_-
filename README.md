## TASK 1
### Credit Scoring Model
#### Overview

This project contains a machine learning model for credit scoring. The model predicts the likelihood of default on a credit application based on various features provided by the applicant.

#### Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset containing historical credit application data. The dataset consists of both numerical and categorical features such as age, income, employment status, and credit history.

#### Model Development

The machine learning model was developed using Python programming language and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. The model was trained using a supervised learning algorithm, specifically a random forest classifier, due to its ability to handle complex datasets and nonlinear relationships between features.

#### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the model was evaluated using standard evaluation metrics for classification tasks including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## TASK 2
### Handwritten Character Recognition Model
#### Overview

This project contains a machine learning model for predicting handwritten characters. The model takes an image of a handwritten character as input and predicts the corresponding character.

#### Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset containing images of handwritten characters. The dataset consists of grayscale images of individual characters, each labeled with the corresponding character.

The model leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions, which can aid healthcare professionals in early detection and proactive treatment.

#### Dataset

The medical dataset used for training and evaluation comprises patient records, including demographics, medical history, vital signs, and laboratory test results. The dataset is obtained from reputable sources and undergoes preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency.

#### Model Development

The disease prediction model is developed using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. It employs a combination of feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning to build an effective predictive model. The architecture may vary depending on the specific disease being predicted, with considerations for scalability, interpretability, and performance.

#### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the disease prediction model is evaluated using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's predictive capabilities, including its ability to correctly identify positive and negative cases, minimize false positives and false negatives, and achieve overall predictive accuracy.
