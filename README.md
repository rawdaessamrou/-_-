# CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship Tasks

## TASK 1
### Credit Scoring Model
#### Overview

This project contains a machine learning model for credit scoring. The model predicts the likelihood of default on a credit application based on various features provided by the applicant.

#### Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset containing historical credit application data. The dataset consists of both numerical and categorical features such as age, income, employment status, and credit history.

#### Model Development

The machine learning model was developed using Python programming language and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. The model was trained using a supervised learning algorithm, specifically a random forest classifier, due to its ability to handle complex datasets and nonlinear relationships between features.

#### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the model was evaluated using standard evaluation metrics for classification tasks including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## TASK 2
### Handwritten Character Recognition Model
#### Overview

This project contains a machine learning model for predicting handwritten characters. The model takes an image of a handwritten character as input and predicts the corresponding character.

#### Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset containing images of handwritten characters. The dataset consists of grayscale images of individual characters, each labeled with the corresponding character.

#### Model Development

The machine learning model was developed using Python programming language and popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of neural network commonly used for image classification tasks.

#### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the model was evaluated using standard evaluation metrics for classification tasks including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the confusion matrix was used to assess the model's performance on individualÂ classes.
